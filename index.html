            Frontend Web Developer | 1 Year<br>
            During my year at Tech Force Pakistan, I specialized in frontend web development, mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. 
            I gained practical experience in creating responsive and interactive web pages, applying modern design principles, 
            and utilizing version control with Git. This experience has honed my skills in building dynamic and user-friendly web interfaces.
